<h3>What is this course about?</h3>
This course is dedicated to studying LAMMPS, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package. Although LAMMPS is applicable to many fields of science, <b>the course is specially prepared for material scientists.</b><br><br>

The course gives self-learning materials, by which you can study LAMMPS step-by-step. The goal of the couse is to understand its basics and to be ready for advancing to the next level, where you can apply this software package to practical purposes such as engineering and academic projects. <br><br>

The course assumes that you have a minimum computing environment, that is, you have a common WindowsPC or Macintosh on which you'll perform light MD simulations. I believe this is not a difficult condition for those who want to study LAMMPS.<br><br>

Although the theory of MD is based on statistical physics and may not be easy to understand, it is not necessary for LAMMPS beginners to fully understand the theory. The beginners only need to understand grammatical rules of scripting language that commands how each MD simulation is executed in LAMMPS. This is the greatest advantage of applying well-maintained software packages whose bugs are almost all eliminated. Therefore, the goal of the course is almost equivalent to understanding the basics of the LAMMPS scripting language. <br><br>
		
<h3>Before you start this course</h3>
First of all, you need to install the LAMMPS package at <a href="https://docs.lammps.org/Install.html">LAMMPS install site</a>, which offers comprehensive information on how to install this package. I would recommended a pre-compiled version for the beginners.<br><br>

In addition, you'll need a working space for the execution of LAMMPS. For this purpose, make <em>work</em> directory somewhere you feel convenient on your computer. Then download and unzip <a href="script.zip">script.zip</a> and <a href="potentials.zip">potentials.zip</a>. These directories must be moved to <em>work</em> directory, that is, <em>work</em> directory has two sub-directories called <em>script</em> and <em>potentials</em>.<br><br>
 
In addition to installing LAMMPS, you need to install a free visualisation tool called <a href="https://www.ovito.org">OVITO</a>. The tool works well both on Windows and MacOS. In case of MacOS, Apple Silicon M1 or later is necessary. Later in this course, the simulation results are often visualised using this package for verification.<br><br>

After successfully installing LAMMPS and OVITO, you are ready to go ahead. The course consists of several independent lectures as seen in <a href="index.html">Contents</a> page. Because each lecture uses the knowledge learned in previous lectures, the best method to study in this course is to <b>walk through</b> from the beginning in order.<br><br>
